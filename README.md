This is a bowling game calculator.

Project template is from Create react app with typescript template.

To start an app run `npm start`.

By default there is 3 gamers with predefined names: Jack, Don, Andy.
I didn't make a form to add/remove users.

I didn't write any test - validation is enougth to fill all cases of such simple app.
I used MobX and react-hook-form for the first time, so i don't know about best practicies where store should be stored.
I didn't use any UI library.
No mobile.
