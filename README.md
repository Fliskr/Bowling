This is a bowling game calculator.

Project template is from Create react app with typescript template.

To start an app run `npm start`.

By default there is 3 players with predefined names: Jack, Don, Andy.
Near each name there are 2 icons: Dice and Reset with just unicode defined chars. Dice will generate random frame and Reset will reset game for current user. Also you can reset all users by button at top of page.

No form to add/remove users.
No tests - validation is enougth to fill all cases of such simple app.
No UI library used.
No mobile.
I used MobX and react-hook-form for the first time, so i don't know about best practicies where store should be stored.
